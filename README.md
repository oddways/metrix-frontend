This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

## Getting Started
First, run "yarn" in your bash to install all Dependencies

Second, run the development server:

```bash

yarn dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


P.S. For the graphcharts, i used images instead of a libary since there's no live data to work with.
Also, my intentions for using both redux and context is because i want a Global Context to handle clientside states that controls Navbar Toggle and Responsiveness while Redux controls the client/server data and handles all reducers needed throughout the entire app.
